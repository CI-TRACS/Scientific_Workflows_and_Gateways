In this workshop, discussions will include an introduction to scientific gateways and workflows. Attendees will learn how gateways and workflows may benefit their research and about some existing gateways that may be suitable for their scientific interests. For the hands-on portion, attendees will access and use HydroShare, a gateway built for water-resource sciences. Activities will include navigating HydroShare and its available tools and web apps and creating a data resource which can be used for collaboration with others in the scientific community. Attendees will also use an existing workflow to perform computational tasks on some data to demonstrate the ease and benefits of using community-developed tools for data analysis. 


> ## Prerequisites
>
> * Create a HydroShare account. 
> * In HydroShare, search for and request to join CUAHSI JupyterHub web app group
>
{: .prereq}

By the end of this workshop, students will know how to:

* Have a basic understanding of scientific workflows and gateways.
* Have a basic understanding of resources which can help them discover and develop new scientific gateways.
* Have a basic understanding of how to explore and use a scientific gateway. This workshop will use HydroShare, a data management solution for hydrological data, models, and code.
* Have a basic understanding of how to use HydroSHare's tools and web apps to create a data resource, carry out computational tasks on data using existing workflows, and share that resource with other researchers in the community.
