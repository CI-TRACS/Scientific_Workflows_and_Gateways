## Using Science Gateways 
Using a gateway will be the main focus of this workshop. The audience will get firat-hand experience using a scientific gateway with a predetermined dataset. The gateway we will be exploring in the next epidsode is HydroShare, a gateway created for water sciences and sharing and analyzing water data. 

Each gateway is an independent project with its own guideline for access to it's community and resources. Although they usually target specific research communities, they are available to most. Each gateway acts as a portal to computational and data resources for researchers, educators, engineers and students. 

> Depending on the needs of the communities, a gateway may provide any of the 
> following features:

> - High-performance computation resources
> - Workflow tools
> - General or domain-specific analytic and visualization software
> - Collaborative interfaces
> - Job submission tools
> - Education modules

## Developing and Integrating Science Gateways
Scientific gateways can be helpful when developing a data management plan for a research project. There are resources available to those interested in developing a gateway for their research community. 

### XSEDE

The Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment, Xsede, can support science gateways in many ways. XSEDE is a single virtual system that provides advanced research computing resources and services. XSEDE can provide virtual machine hosting for scientific gateways and their services. Gateway developers can also benefit from XSEDES collaborative support services which help gateway providers integrate gateways with XSEDE resources. 

> More information on how to turn a project into a science gateway using XSEDE
> can be found at the [XSEDE website](https://www.xsede.org/ecosystem/science-gateways).

Providers of XSEDE services support community accounts allowing gateways to execute scientific applications on XSEDE resources as a generic gateway user. Users do not need to create XSEDE accounts to use a gateway. 

### Scientific Gateways Community and Institute
{% include figure.html url="" max-width="50%"

   alt="" caption="" %}

In 2016, a team led by San Diego Supercomputing Center was awarded a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant to establish an institute to accelerate the development of scientific gateways which address the needs of researchers across NSF's directorates. This institute bacame the Scientific Gateways Community and Institute.

Organizations like Scientific Gateways Community and Institute provide great resources to help when building a scientific gateway. Their goal is to facilitate the sharing of experiences, technologies, and practices of those working with science gateways. SGCI hosts workshops on developing, operating and sustaining gateways as well as provides a science gateway catalog giving users a means to discover gateways within different disciplines. Furthermore, SGCI provides regular tech summits to help developers find solutions to common gateway-related issues. 

> ## SGCI Offerings
> SGCI offers a full range of services and expertise including:
> - Building and running Gateways
> - Software developers offer their expertise in building or enhancing an 
> existing gateway in the areas of graphic design, cybersecurity, business 
> and sustainability planning, and user engagement.
> - Usability and user engagement which are parts of sustainability. Stakeholder 
> engagement is crucial in terms of keeping in the loop.
> - Free hosting allowing gateway builders to test frameworks.
> - Community Resources & Networking
> - Education and Training



> SGCI provides larger scale training, consulting services, learning 
> opportunities and community which can be found at the [SGCI website](https://sciencegateways.org). 


### A Good Example of Developing a Gateway: IKEWAI

A good example of a scientific gateway is the University of Hawai'i's Ikewai Project. For more information on how the gateway plan was developed, how funding was generated for it, and how the cyberinfrastructure for it was procured please see an Ikewai developer. 


## Examples of Some Existing Scientific Gateways

The following are some examples of existing scientific gateways which may be of interest to the audience. Attendees may visit these gateways and discover communities sharing domain specific data and workflows which may assist in their research projects. 

### CyberInfrastructure for Phylogenetic REsearch, CIPRES 
{% include figure.html url="" max-width="50%"

   alt="" caption="" %}
[CIPRES](https://www.phylo.org/) is a gateway for systematic and population biology and Phylogenetics related research. It allows researchers to explore relationships between species using supercomputers provided by NSF's XSEDE. Backed by an NSF award, CIPRES was developed to make supercomputing resources more accessible and flexible for phylogenetic researchers and is among the most popular gateways in the XSEDE community. It has supported more than 12,000 users and been a part of 1,300 publications on phylogenetics.

[ChemCompute](https://chemcompute.org/) is a scientific gateway targeted towards the chemistry community and students. According to ChemCompute's website, it provides computational chemistry software for undergraduate teaching and research. Their website contains pages for accessing data, various simulation and solver tools, as well as support for computational job submittals to their cloud clusters for workflow applications. ChemCompute's goal is to enable faculty to incorporate computational chemistry into their undergraduate teaching and research curriculum without the hassle of compiling, installing, and maintaining software and hardware.
