In the following sections, examples are provided to gain hands-on experience discovering groups and resources of interest, joining a collaborative environment, and performing analysis on data who's results can be written back to HydroShare to share with others in the group. 

More specifically, users will learn the following:
- How to create a HydroShare group
- How to discover and join an existing group of interest
- How to navigate the groups landing page and access it's resources
- How to use an existing workflow to carry out some data analysis using a JupyterHub workflow 
- How to write results back into HydroShare as a new resource to share your analysis with others. 

## Discovering/Finding a HydroShare Group

HydroShare provides a simple search functionality to help users discover and find groups within its site. Use the Collaborate tab at the top of the HydroShare page. 

{% include figure.html url="" max-width="50%"
   file="/fig/collaboratetab.png"
   alt="" caption="" %}

The Find Groups page can then be used to find a listing of discoverable and public groups available. Using the search function users can enter keywords which may be associated with group names, purpose, descriptions and other keywords indexed by the group owner.

{% include figure.html url="" max-width="50%"
   file="/fig/findgroups.png"
   alt="Connect to cluster" caption="" %}

> ## Discover the HI-DSI Group
> Use HydroShare's search functionality to find the HydroShare group named, "HI-DSI Gateways and Workflows".
> 
{: .callout}

Click on the title of any listed group to view the groups landing page. Members of public groups can be seen by searching users while the members of a discoverable group can not be seen. Either way users can request group membership.


## Joining a Group

Once a group of interest is found, users can request access by click the "Ask to join" button. If the owner of the group has not set the "auto accept" option for new requests, users may experience a wait time until their request is processed. Otherwise, access may be granted almost immediately. 

> ## Join the HI-DSI Group
> Once the "HI-DSI Gateways and Workflows" group is found, request access by 
> clicking, "Ask to join".
> 
{: .callout}

## About Groups
A groups landing page will provide some information about the group such as the groups title, purpose and description of the group. From the landing page, users will be able to see all resources shared with the group as well as all members of the group. It should be noted that resources within the group are not owned by all members. While they are shared, ownership is retained by the individual user which created the resource.

## Exercise: Using Resources and Workflows Within a Group to Collaborate On Data Analysis

For this exercise, attendees who have joined the HI-DSI group will use an existing shared resource containing both data and a Jupyter Notebook workflow to perform some visualization and data analysis. The purpose of this exercise is to: 
- Demonstrate how a gateway can provide a collaborative environment
- Demonstrate how data workflows can ease the researchers burden of programming certain computational tasks from scratch.
- Exemplify the usefulness of gateways and workflows in the reproducibility of scientific results.   

HydroShare supports various web apps which workflows and models can be built in. Typically, most hydrological modeling and data analysis is done on a personal computer or on some centralized computing system. A user's knowledge  of such centralized computing system, such as high-performance computing systems, capacity of a local computer, compatability and dependency requirements for installation on local computers, and time taken to get local model installations properly configured and validated could all be barriers to the user's research. 

By providing and supporting web apps such as JupyterHUb and its Jupyter Notebook functionality, HydroShare enables a more flexible environment for model execution and data analysis. This gives users a preconfigured environment free of worry about cyberinfrastructure and dependencies thus lowering the forementioned barriers to research.

A Jupyter notebook contains live code, equations, visualization, and explanatory text. They can be used to implement scientific workflows and other computational tasks. HydroShare users can either create and share their own workflows using Jupyter notebooks or discover and use existing workflows implemented as Jupyter notebooks. 

> ## Jupyter Notebook functionality within HydroShare:
> - Notebooks can be launched from HydroShare
> - Notebooks can access the contents of HydroShare resources
> - Notebooks can save results back into HydroShare

### Ease of Use For the User
The code within a Jupyter notebook can execute operating and language specific commands within the hosting environment. This provides users with access to the hosting environments computational capabilities while eliminating the need for users to install and configure software. 

While this does not relieve the user from needing to learn the programming language, operating system commands, or commands associated with the program being used for analysis, it does remove the need for users to install and have the capacity to run these programs locally. 

## About the Following Exercise
For this exercise attendees will be performing some visualization and data analysis on a raw .tif file of a geographic region.

### The Data
The data used will be a single image. The file was raster data of a surface map and was saved as a .tiff format. It is an aerial image of a mountain and water source in Utah.

> Rasters are well suited for representing data that changes continuouosly across a surface landscape. They provide an effective method of 
> storing the continuity as a surface. Elevation values measured from the Earth's surface are the most common application of surface maps.

> ## About TauDem:
> Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation Models (TauDEM) is a software for Hydrologic Terrain Analysis in Jupyter. TauDEM is a free and 
> open source set of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) tools for the extraction and analysis of hydrologic information from topography as 
> represented by DEM. This software is developed at Utah State University (USU) for hydrologic digital elevation model analysis and watershed 
> delineation.

The idea behind using this notebook and its model/workflow is Once you recognize the pattern from this, you can refer to documentation on the use of each TauDEM function found at http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/documentation.html, and construct other analyses to meet your needs.

This is an example of the collaboration which a gateway can provide its users. 


### Step 1 

Once on the group landing page, select the resource titled "Introduction to TauDem and click "Open with" at top right. Choose CUAHSI JupyterHub as the webapp.

## Step 2

Here we will briefly go through the Jupyter notebook Dr. Tarboton has provided us with the intention to construct other analyses to meet our research needs as we become familiar with the computational tasks TauDEM helps us solve.

The hydroshare module provides functions for interacting with HydroShare, including resource querying, dowloading and creation. 
The taudem module provides functions for workspace maintenance as well as visualization. 



    # Only run this cell if the libraries are not already installed
    !pip install rasterio
    !pip install geopandas
    !pip install hstools
  
  
  
    import os
    import rasterio as rio
    %matplotlib inline
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib import colors



    ! pwd



    ! ls


We start with a DEM file surrounding the Logan River Watershed in Logan, Utah. logan.ti. In this section, we illustrate the TauDEM basic grid analysis functions. TIFF format used as a default by TauDEM.

First, Define convenience plotting function and then call that function on our data file.

    # Define convenience plotting function
    cmap='terrain'
    label='Elevation (m)'
    import math
    import numpy as np
    def rp(raster,cmap='terrain',label='',bounds=[]):
        with rio.open(raster) as src:
            boundary = src.bounds
            parray = src.read()
            nodata = src.nodata
            parray=np.where(parray == nodata,math.nan,parray)

        # Plot the imported data
        plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
        # if using bounds
        if(len(bounds) > 0):
            bounds=np.insert(bounds,0,np.nanmin(parray))
            bounds=np.append(bounds,np.nanmax(parray))
            norm = colors.BoundaryNorm(bounds, cmap.N)
            imgplot = plt.imshow(parray[0],cmap=cmap,norm=norm)
        else:
            imgplot = plt.imshow(parray[0],cmap=cmap)
        cbar = plt.colorbar()
        cbar.set_label(label)
        # plt.savefig('LoganDEM.png', dpi=450, bbox_inches = 'tight')   # activate this command if you want to save the figure. Note that it should be called before plt.show()
        plt.show()

This produces a surface map showing the elevation

    # display the raw dem
    dem = 'logan.tif'
    rp(dem,label="Elevation (m)",)
    

{% include figure.html url="" max-width="50%"
   file="/fig/loganraw.png"
   alt="Connect to cluster" caption="" %}


The first TauDEM function used is Pit Remove. Pits are grid cells surrounded by higher terrain that do not drain. Pit Remove creates a hydrologically conditioned DEM by raising the elevation of pits to the point where they overflow their confining pour point and can drain to the edge of the domain

It appears that this function creates a better conditioned image for further analysis. Preprocessing of sorts.

Recall that 'dem' is out logan.tif file. The output of this function will provide information on how long execution might take along with some other system and file information. 


    !mpiexec -n 4 pitremove {dem} 

After execution is done there will be an additional file which is a hydrologically conditioned DEM by raising the elevation of pits.


    ! ls  # This lists the files present.  
    # Note you should see the additional output file loganfel.tif that was written by the previous command.

    loganfel.tif	  logan.tif   Outlet_meta.xml	 Outlet.shp
    logan_meta.xml	  logan.vrt   Outlet.prj	 Outlet.shx
    logan_resmap.xml  Outlet.dbf  Outlet_resmap.xml  TauDEM.ipynb


This new file is then used to run a D8 analysis. The output will be two additional files and the function calculates d8 flow directions and d8 slopes. This outputs a flow direction grid and a slope grid. The output file names are loganp.tif and logansd8.tif. 

About calculating flow and slopes using D8 method.
Calculates the direction of flow from each cell to its downslope neighbor or neighbors using the D8, D-Infinity (DINF), or Multiple Flow Direction (MFD) method.

This calculation will take some time to complete as it runs the necessary computation and produces the output files.

    !mpiexec -n 4 d8flowdir -p loganp.tif -sd8 logansd8.tif -fel loganfel.tif  

Calling the plotting function we can see the results

    rp('loganp.tif',plt.get_cmap('gist_earth', 8),'D8 Flow Direction')
    rp('logansd8.tif','terrain','D8 Slope')

{% include figure.html url="" max-width="50%"
   file="/fig/code6.png"
   alt="Connect to cluster" caption="" %}
   

The next cell runs a sequence of TauDEM functions to identify the optimal threshold to use to delineate the stream network using TauDEM's stream drop analysis approach based on weighted contributing area of upward curved grid cells mapped using the Peuker Douglas algorithm. Outlet.shp is used as the outlet.

The last command "drop analysis" tests a number of stream delineation thresholds and identifies the threshold where the mean stream drop for first order streams is not statistically different from the mean stream drop of higher order streams. This approach identifies the highest resolution stream network consistent with the constant stream drop property and is an objective way to map stream networks consistent with the DEM geomorphology and objectively determine drainage density.

This will take a few minutes. Outputs some runtime information loganp.tif, loganfel.tif, loganss.tif, loganssa.tif, loganad8o.tif



    !mpiexec -n 4 aread8 -p loganp.tif -o Outlet.shp -ad8 loganad8o.tif
    !mpiexec -n 8 peukerdouglas -fel loganfel.tif -ss loganss.tif -par 0.4 0.1 0.05
    !mpiexec -n 8 aread8 -p loganp.tif -ad8 loganssa.tif -wg loganss.tif -o Outlet.shp
    !mpiexec -n 8 dropanalysis -fel loganfel.tif -p loganp.tif -ad8 loganad8o.tif -ssa loganssa.tif -o Outlet.shp -drp logandrp.txt -par 10   1000 15 0

    # Determine threshold from last line of drp.txt file after colon.
    with open("logandrp.txt", 'r') as f:
        lines = f.read().splitlines()
    thresh=lines[len(lines)-1].split(":")[1]
    print("\nOptimal stream definition threshold:"+thresh)
    
    
Plot results.
The following is the stream network and the portions of which contribute more flow within the watershed. This will be useful to perform the next analysis of the stream network using TauDEM.
  
    rp('loganad8o.tif',colors.ListedColormap(['white', 'lightskyblue', 'cyan', 'blue', 'navy']),'D8 Contributing area',bounds=[300,1000,3000,10000])   

{% include figure.html url="" max-width="50%"
   file="/fig/code9.png"
   alt="Connect to cluster" caption="" %}
   
   
## Stream Network Analysis using TauDEM functions

Here the stream network is extracted using the threshold determined above and the weighted contributing area of Peuker Douglas upward curved grid cells.
The function, threshold, defines a stream raster grid (logansrc.tif) by applying a threshold to the input. In this case, the input is (1) the weighted contributing area (stream source accumulation or ssa) loganssa.tif, and (2) the threshold determined above.


    !mpiexec -n 4 threshold -ssa loganssa.tif -src logansrc.tif -thresh {thresh}
    !mpiexec -n 4 streamnet -fel loganfel.tif -p loganp.tif -ad8 loganad8o.tif -src logansrc.tif -ord loganord3.tif -tree logantree.dat -coord logancoord.dat -net logannet.shp -w loganw.tif -o Outlet.shp
 
The streamnet function produces a number of outputs that will be illustrated below. These include a shapefile of the stream network (logannet.shp) and subwatersheds (loganw.tif) draining to each link of the stream network shapefile. The required inputs for this function are loganp.tif, loganfel.tif, loganad8o.tif, logansrc.tif, and Outlet.shp. 
 
Plotting visualization of watershed delineated.

    rp('loganw.tif')    
    
{% include figure.html url="" max-width="50%"
   file="/fig/code12.png"
   alt="Connect to cluster" caption="" %}
 
 
Function calls will depend on certain outputs from outher functions. There will be multiple output file getting saved in the directory and ultimately in the resource which is written back to HydroShare.
 
    !ls
    loganad8o.tif	logannet.shp	  loganssa.tif	 Outlet_meta.xml
    logancoord.dat	logannet.shx	  loganss.tif	 Outlet.prj
    logandrp.txt	loganord3.tif	  logan.tif	 Outlet_resmap.xml
    loganfel.tif	loganp.tif	  logantree.dat  Outlet.shp
    logan_meta.xml	logan_resmap.xml  logan.vrt	 Outlet.shx
    logannet.dbf	logansd8.tif	  loganw.tif	 TauDEM.ipynb
    logannet.prj	logansrc.tif	  Outlet.dbf
    
 
Next The geopandas library is used to visualize the shapefile. On some computers you may need to locate and install this
    
    
    from geopandas import GeoSeries, GeoDataFrame, read_file, gpd

    streamnet = read_file('logannet.shp')
    streamnet
    
 You can use this to inspect and lot the pour points which can help analyze potential effects on an area do to the watershed.   
    
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(30, 24))
    streamnet.plot()
    
    
{% include figure.html url="" max-width="50%"
   file="/fig/code16.png"
   alt="Connect to cluster" caption="" %}

Congratulations! You have successfully delineated subwatershed and a stream network using TauDEM. If you want to retain your work you could at this point save the contents of your folder back to HydroShare, or download them.

## Save the Results back into HydroShare

We'll be using the hstools library to save our data back to HydroShare. Run the following commands to learn more about how to use this tool.

Recall that although hydroshare and jupyterhub are on different servers, they can communicate via the hydroshare rest api
We can use ! hs --help to learn how to use hydroshare utilities.


    
    !hs --help
    
    usage: hs {get, add, create, delete, list, describe, init} [-h, --help]

    HSTools is a humble collection of tools for interacting with data in the
    HydroShare repository. It wraps the HydroShare REST API to provide simple
    commands for working with resources.

    positional arguments:
      {get,add,create,delete,list,describe,init}
        get                 Retrieve resource content from HydroShare
        add                 Add files to an existing HydroShare resource
        create              Create a new HydroShare resource
        delete              Delete a HydroShare resource
        list                List HydroShare resources that you own
        describe            Describe metadata and files
        init                Initialize a connection with HydroShare

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      




    !hs create --help
    usage: hs create  [-q] [-v] [-f] [-k] [-t] [-a] [-h]

    Create a new HydroShare resource

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -a ABSTRACT [ABSTRACT ...], --abstract ABSTRACT [ABSTRACT ...]
                        resource description
      -t TITLE [TITLE ...], --title TITLE [TITLE ...]
                        resource title
      -k KEYWORDS [KEYWORDS ...], --keywords KEYWORDS [KEYWORDS ...]
                        space separated list of keywords
      -f FILES [FILES ...], --files FILES [FILES ...]
                        space separated list of files
      -v                    verbose output
      -q                    suppress output
  



    !ls
    loganad8o.tif	logannet.shp	  loganssa.tif	 Outlet_meta.xml
    logancoord.dat	logannet.shx	  loganss.tif	 Outlet.prj
    logandrp.txt	loganord3.tif	  logan.tif	 Outlet_resmap.xml
    loganfel.tif	loganp.tif	  logantree.dat  Outlet.shp
    logan_meta.xml	logan_resmap.xml  logan.vrt	 Outlet.shx
    logannet.dbf	logansd8.tif	  loganw.tif	 TauDEM.ipynb
    logannet.prj	logansrc.tif	  Outlet.dbf


First, define all of the required metadata for resource creation, i.e. title, abstract, keywords, content files.
Note: Make sure you save the notebook at this point, so that all notebook changes will be saved into the new HydroShare resource.
Optional : Define the resource from which this "new" content has been derived. This is one method for tracking resource provenance.


    # define metadata variables
   
    keywords = ['TauDEM', 'Logan River']
    abstract = "Jupyter Notebook TauDEM was used to define streamflow and subwatersheds in the Logan River Watershed in Utah."

    title = "Test TauDEM Result" 
    files = !find . -maxdepth 1 -type f     # shows all the files created
    print(files)

    # Select the files that you want to save
    files = ['./logan.tif', './TauDEM.ipynb', 
            'Outlet.shp','Outlet.prj',
            'Outlet.shx','Outlet.dbf'
    ]
  


Initializing hydroshare is awkward within hydroshare but you can use hs init on the command line. 
This provides authorization at current location to write into hydroshare
You will be asked to sign into hydroshare to connect


    # Initialize HydroShare connection
    # This is an awkward way to initialize the HydroShare connection from inside Jupyter.  An alternative is to open
    # a terminal and run hs init
    import hstools as hs
    import os
    import sys
    import json
    import base64
    import argparse
    from getpass import getpass
    from hstools import hydroshare
    def init(loc='.'):
        fp = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(loc, '.hs_auth'))
        if os.path.exists(fp):
            print(f'Auth already exists: {fp}')
            remove = input('Do you want to replace it [Y/n]')
            if remove.lower() == 'n':
                sys.exit(0)
            os.remove(fp)

        usr = input('Enter HydroShare Username: ')
        pwd = getpass('Enter HydroShare Password: ')

        dat = {'usr': usr,
              'pwd': pwd}
        cred_json_string = str.encode(json.dumps(dat))
        cred_encoded = base64.b64encode(cred_json_string)
        with open(fp, 'w') as f:
            f.write(cred_encoded.decode('utf-8'))

        try:
            hydroshare.hydroshare(authfile=fp)
        except Exception:
            print('Authentication Failed')
            os.remove(fp)
            sys.exit(1)

        print(f'Auth saved to: {fp}')
    init('/home/jovyan')
    

Finally create a resource in hydroshare.
Output will provide a link to that resource.
By going back to hydroshare and looking under My Resources it will be there and can be shared with the group. If it's not already in the group be sure to share it with the group. 

In conclusion gateways and workflows help researcher collaborate, reproduce science, and satisfy data management plans. Existing workflows also get you up and running on some complucated things quite fast.

Do not delete:
Information about the data. It is a single image for this particular example and enough for all purposes.
raster data as a surface map. It is saved in a .tiff format and is an aerial image of some mountain and water source in Utah. Rasters are well suited for representing data that changes continuously across a landscape (surface). They provide an effective method of storing the continuity as a surface. Elevation values measured from the earth's surface are the most common application of surface maps.
