## HydroShare

According to the HydroShare website, HydroShare is a web based hydrologic information system. It is developed and maintained by Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) and was established for users to share and publish data and models. HydroShare makes this information available in a citable, shareable and discoverable manner.

This collaborative aspect of HydroShare is one of its most useful features. It enables users to work as teams in a web-based environment. Additionally, HydroShare includes tools such as web applications backed by computational resources which can be used to perform tasks on data within HydroShare. These web apps usually provide users with scientific workflows to perform computational analysis. 

HydroShare has several functionalities which can provide overall research and educational advancement. These functionalities include the following:

- Archiving and Disseminating Data

  HydroShare enables users to upload and store data and corresponding metadata. Data and models uploaded into HydroShare can be assigned citation information which can be used to reference it. By permanently publishing and obtaining a citable digital object identifier (DOI) for resources in HydroShare, resources may no longer be edited and are stored in HydroShare. This data can then be discoverable and be used for reproducibility of research. This is an important feature for satisfying data management plans when research finalizes.

- Collaboration

  Users can control who the data and models are shared with. This helps users connect with other members in their research community, collaborate and receive constructive feedback about their work. HydroShare allows users to create or join groups with common research interests. By sharing data and models with other researchers in their community, users can not only connect with other colleagues within the same field, but also collaborate on research and recieve appropriate feedback from other community members.

- Discover and Use Existing Datasets

  HydroShare provides functions to help users discover data and models within it's platform. It consists of a wide range of users many of which contribute data and models to users with particular research interests.



## How HydroShare Works

Typical use of HydroShare includes a few steps. These include:

- Create data

  This step involves the act of collecting data. This can be collecting data using sensors, taking images, or any other method. HydroShare supports a variey of data types i.e. GIS, NetCDF, etc.

- Upload to HydroShare

  By uploading data to HydroShare, the user is provided a place to store the information and given the option to make it open and accessible. Alternatively, the user can retain privacy until ready. Uploading is simple through the web user interface. HydroShare automatically extracts as much metadata as it can from the files uploaded.
- Describe with metadata

  HydroShare enables users to annotate data with metadata. This annotation makes data interpretable and makes discoverable. Together, data and metadata form what HydroShare refers to as a resource.
- Share with colleagues

  Users can share data and models with individuals or make them publicly accesible. There are various method to interact with other researchers. Sharing within a group particularly, gives all members interested in a specific research topic the ability to access that resource and collaborate.
- Permanently publish

  When a HydroShare publishes data they recieve a digital object identifyer (DOI). This enables users to cite their data resource and reference it in related journals publications. Additionally, DOI's provide your readers to find your data. 


This is what HS homepage looks like. There is a nice description of overall process promoted.

## HydroShare Resources

HydroShare's website defines a "resource" as the fundamental unit of digital content in HydroShare that contains data and/or model files and their corresponding metadata. Resources act as a container into which the sharable content is placed. 

Together, data, models and their metadata form the resource which acts as the single unit of digital content on which much of HydroShare's functionality is based on. A resource can hold multiple files of different types and enables users to manage access, version, and share with colleagues and collaborative groups. Content within a resource can be either public or private each with their own unique identifier, url, or DOI if published.

All resources within HydroShare each have their own landing page. This page displays all resource metadata and it's content files. Upon logging into a HydroShare account, the user can access resources created or that others have shared in the "My Resources" section.

**********************

Users can access a resources landing page different ways.

- They can click on resources which were discovered using HydroShare's 'Discover' feature.

- Using a direct link or citation to a HydroShare resource.

Additionally, users can download content files of a resource using the Content sections download buttons. 

## Creating a Resource and Uploading Data

In this section, readers will read about how HydroShare stores and describes data. They will also get a chance to follow along and create their own resource and share amongst other members or keep it private. 

To upload data to HydroShare, users must first sign up and into their account. In the users profile page:

- Click on the Create button in the top right navigation menu.

   alt="Connect to cluster" caption="" %}


- From the dropdown, select Resource.

{% include figure.html url="" max-width="100%"
   file="/fig/resourcebutton.png"
   alt="Connect to cluster" caption="" %}

- Provide a resource title and click Create

HydroShare will create the new resource and direct to the landing page. The resource is now ready for adding files and metadata. Metadata sections within the resource include but are not limited to sections for abstract, key words, geographic coverage, references, comments, and a content section in which files are added into. 

*************
INSERT IMAGE of a new landing page or be sure to create a new resource and share screen.
Havent screen shot it yet
Note: at this point in the workshop open a resource and go through each metadata section in the resource.
*************

*************
Note: Get attendees to drop a raster file into their content section so that HydroShare automatically fills out some metadata.
Need to provide the attendees a link to the raster file. Figure out a way to do this.
A raster will extract the information into a geotiff
*************

It is important to emphasize the use of metadata to the resource. It is what makes the content within it interpretable and discoverable. If making the resource public or discoverable, users must at least fill out a descriptive title, abstract, and one subject keyword.

Users should organize files into folders as needed and use descriptive names that can be used to delineate data. Also, the "Add Web Content" icon allows users to provide a link to external web resources in the case the user wants to store only metadata while data is stored elsewhere. 

***********
INSERT IMAGE not sure if should insert image yet
Havent screen shot yet.

***********

Users must have editing priviledges on a resource in order to edit it. To verify if one can edit, navigate to the resource landing page and look for a pencil icon in the top right corner. If no pencil icon is visible then the user has no editing rights. Otherwise, clicking on the pencil icon will allow modification to metadata and content files. Users can also delete resources if necessary by clicking the "Delete" buttin on the resources landing page.

> Content in formally published resources can no longer be changed. Limited >metadata fields can be changed however authors, title, and 
> content files can >not be changed. 

More information on how to formally publish data on HydroShare can be found in their help [documentation](https://help.hydroshare.org/creating-and-managing-resources/formally-publishing-data/).
