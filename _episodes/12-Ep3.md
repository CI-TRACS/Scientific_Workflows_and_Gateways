## What HydroShare Is

According to the HydroShare website, HydroShare is a web based hydrologic information system. It is developed and maintained by Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) and was established for users to share and publish data and models. HydroShare makes this information available in a citable, shareable and discoverable manner.

This collaborative aspect of HydroShare is one of its most useful features. It enables users to work as teams in a web-based environment. Additionally, HydroShare includes tools such as web applications backed by computational resources which can be used to perform tasks on data within HydroShare. These web apps usually provide users with scientific workflows to perform computational analysis. 

HydroShare has several functionalities which can provide overall research and educational advancement. These functionalities include the following:

- Archiving and Disseminating Data

  HydroShare enables users to upload and store data and corresponding metadata. Data and models uploaded into HydroShare can be assigned citation information which can be used to reference it. By permanently publishing and obtaining a citable digital object identifier (DOI) for resources in HydroShare, resources may no longer be edited and are stored in HydroShare. This data can then be discoverable and be used for reproducibility of research. This is an important feature for satisfying data management plans when research finalizes.

- Collaboration

  Users can control who the data and models are shared with. This helps users connect with other members in their research community, collaborate and receive constructive feedback about their work. HydroShare allows users to create or join groups with common research interests. By sharing data and models with other researchers in their community, users can not only connect with other colleagues within the same field, but also collaborate on research and recieve appropriate feedback from other community members.

- Discover and Use Existing Datasets

  HydroShare provides functions to help users discover data and models within it's platform. It consists of a wide range of users many of which contribute data and models to users with particular research interests.




What you can do with HydroShare
- Share your data and models with colleagues
- Manage who has access to the content that you share
- Share, access, visualize and manipulate a broad set of hydrologic data types and models
- Use the web services API to program automated and client access
- Publish data and models to meet the requirements of your data management plan
- Discover and access data and models published by others
- Use web apps to visualize, analyze and run models on data in HydroShare
- HydroShare allows you to create resources. Define what resources are and how they are useful.

## Discover
Discover resources in hydroshare using keywords that may pertain to topics of interest to you.

## Collaborate
Collaborate by making groups and define what groups are, Also explain how you can collaborate by creating communities which is a group of groups. Explain how you can give collaborators in your group to view data and access your resources.

## Web Apps
HydroShare apps allow you to visualize, analyze, and work with resources (data and models) in HydroShare. Apps are hosted on separate web servers from the HydroShare website (www.hydroshare.org) and access HydroShare resources using web services via the REST applications programmers interface (API). Anyone can write an app an then create a "Web App" resource that holds the configuration information for launching the App from HydroShare. This page lists CUAHSI approved web apps that are supported as part of HydroShare.
